# 📱 Play Store App Review Analysis

## 🧠 Overview

This project analyzes Google Play Store app metadata and user reviews to uncover the key factors that drive app engagement and success. By combining structured data (e.g., category, rating, installs, price) with unstructured user feedback, we explore how different features and sentiments influence app performance.

The notebook has been refactored to meet production standards, including:
- ✅ Exception handling
- ✅ Modular functions
- ✅ Clean code structure
- ✅ Deployment-ready formatting
